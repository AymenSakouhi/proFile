# 📁 ProFile Lite – Simple File Sharing App

## 🧪 About This Project

**ProFile Lite** is a lightweight file upload and sharing app where authenticated users can upload files and share them via simple, secure links. This project is part of a learning stream to explore and implement modern web technologies in a hands-on way.

## 🎯 Core Features

- ✅ User authentication (email/password or social login)
- ✅ File uploads from the browser
- ✅ List of uploaded files per user
- ✅ Copyable public share links with access control

## 💻 Tech Stack (WIP)

| Category | Tech (To Be Confirmed)        |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| Frontend | Next.js (App Router) or React |
| Auth     | Clerk, NextAuth.js, or custom |
| Storage  | AWS S3, Supabase, or local    |
| Backend  | Bun + Elysia or Express       |
| Database | Supabase, Turso, or SQLite    |

## ⚖️ Architectural Decisions

This project includes documentation of tech decisions and trade-offs, such as:

- Why Next.js or React
- Local vs external storage (e.g. S3)
- Choosing a database and ORM
- Deployment options (e.g. Vercel, Railway)

## 🧪 Requirements

- Only logged-in users can upload/view files
- Public file links must be secure (e.g. signed URLs)
- Max file size: 50MB (adjustable)

## 🌟 Stretch Goals

- Expiring links
- File preview
- Deletion capability
- Type filtering
